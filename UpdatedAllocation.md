I made a copy of Fauconberg under the BDincer Kore so I can compare one versus the other. I added the variables and structures to Fauconberg as a precursor, I need to see how it performs in FWD testing before I add the Risk Mgmt Procedures onto Fauconberg.

I added a few elements to control the Max Cap and Unit Allocation Procedures in Fauconberg.

I ran the most recent backtest using 10/20/30K denoms and this was the result.

HASH

6df1a0d2dc9b73bdcb6f16fd0d84c0bc

- No EOD positions.
- Fewer trades.
- More precision.
- 75 Trades

I don't think that volume is possible for this ticker.

I'll see what the FWD Test does today. 

Comparing AAPL to AAPL, for example - usin gthose two accounts.
