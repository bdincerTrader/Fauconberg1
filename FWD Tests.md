I shut it down early today -working on another model.

** I still \nNeed to run the Unit/ Allocation backtest on a few single names



The only errors/rejects I saw in BD_Fauconberg were the Max Capital errors 
    
- Max cap for an order in QA account is 100K. 
- I am running the algo on 252 symbols simultaneously in FWD testing.

** I use the Unit Allocation parameter/ single symbols (limits ttl exposure).

** If it's ok with you, I want to double check on something tonight/ Tomorrow in back/FWD testing.
** Maybe blacklist a few additional symbols.
